Compared to Omegle, epsile isn't close to it in features
* You can chat with another stranger. If there is no other stranger you'll have to wait.
* If you don't have the tab focused you'll get a popup if someone sends you a message.
* URLs in chat messages are clickable, and opens in a new tab when clicked. Don't click on links from strangers you don't trust!
* If you start your message with "/me " you will send an action. An example is if you write "/me ate a cookie" it will look like "*** Stranger ate a cookie" for the stranger
